### [aka.ms/commands](https://aka.ms/commands)

aka.ms/commands is very similar to [cmd.ms] and lists come of the most common aka.ms short-links and commands.

In a way aka.ms/commands was the pre-cursor to [cmd.ms]. While [aka.ms] is great, most of the memorable and product specific short links have already been reserved for links to the Microsoft product page or docs.

### [MSShells.net](https://msshells.net/)

This site is slightly different to the ones on this page. The focus of MSShells.net is to list all the official Microsoft PowerShell modules to administer Microsoft 365 and Azure in one place.

The 'How to Install' and 'How to Connect' columns for each modules are the hidden gems in this very useful page.
